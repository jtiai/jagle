# Jagle

Jagle to C++ transpiler

Jagle is BASIC derivative language and this tool transpiles Jagle syntax
to C++ syntax.

## Jagle syntax

TBD, see small example at [end of page](#example-program)

## Build instructions

Prerequisities:
* CMake
* git
* C++ C++17 capable compiler
* Java compiler (JDK 8+)
* Ninja/make any other CMake supported build system

Clone the repo and change dir to repository root.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jtiai/jagle.git
$ cd jagle
```

Use CMake to build 
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

Build
```sh
$ ninja
```

Note: First time build will take time. Antlr4-runtime compilation is slow.

## Jagle config

The file `jagle.toml` has to be configured for compiler, example is provided
for Windows machines and must be changed accordingly.
```toml
[compiler]
keep_source = true
cmd = "c:/msys64/mingw64/bin/g++.exe -std=c++17 {source} -o {target}.exe -static-libstdc++"
```

* `keep_source` is not used currently, please leave it as `true` for time being.
* `cmd` is executable command to be used to compile C++ source generated by jagle
transpiler. Two macros are supported:
	* `{source}` macro contains generated CPP with the extension of `.cpp`.
	* `{target}` macro contains name for generated executable without extension.

## Example program
```basic
a: int = 2
b: int = Nothing
for b = 1 to 10
print a; " x "; b; " = "; a * b
next
```
